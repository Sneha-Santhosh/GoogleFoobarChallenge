# GoogleFoobarChallenge
Questions and answers for Google's secret foo.bar challenge.


Google has a secret challenge for coders who do a lot of Google searches related to coding. When searching on Google, I got a pop-up saying "Curious developers are known to seek interesting problems. Solve one from Google?".  

Completed level 1 of the challenge using Java.

Here's my level 1 bunny hopping around after I solved the problem.
